# SPECIFIC ACTIONS
### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OVERALL IT IS JULY! Erk, erk, alert, alert. Feel the urgency.
NOTES:
  Keep objectives really neat and short to help focus

## Actions 240701:
- DONE Complete pipelines enough to get to usable data
- DONE Output to single CSV
- INITIAL LOOK Select and target ATP data
- - Jeff Sackman data, available just needs sorting columns and data-types
- - actual ATP data scraping didn't fire, needs more attention

## Actions 240702:
- Ensure getting ATP data works
- Run Naive model

## Actions 240703:
- Run first manual prediction
- Plot learning curves

## WEEKEND:
## Actions 240629:
- Relax - do CNC, be in the garden, spend time with the family
## Actions 240630:
- As with 240629

# LAST WEEK:

## Actions 240628 FRIDAY:
- OUTSTANDING Confirm initially if 1 model or 2 seperate ones will be used
  - Consider training times on the C&W datasets


## Actions 240627 THURSDAY:
- OUTSTANDING Decide on what model will be first employed: the Naive Model
- OUTSTANDING Employ the Naive model(s)
- OUTSTANDING Draw learning curves


## Actions 240626 WEDNESDAY:
- Ready pipeline to sort all required columns
- - DONE: Boolean => 240625, boolean_transformer
- - OUTSTANDING Numerical
- - OUTSTANDING Check ATP data - is % or float etc and look to match
- - Others?

- OUTSTANDING Consider when is best to:
- - Take just the 2010 to 2018 data => confirm numbers of rows for C&W datasets
- - Split the data into Challenger and Winner (C&W) datasets

- OUTSTANDING Consider: Output data to csv to avoid re-running steps


## Actions 240625:
- DONE Run a pipeline that can adjust datatypes (booleans getting sorted)
- DONE Consider initial columns to be included => matched v available ATP data
- SKIPPED Output data to csv to avoid re-running steps => not worth it yet
