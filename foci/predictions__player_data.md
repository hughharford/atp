# Player data is crucial, without it a prediction will be meaningless

Cannot realistically use ALETC data, there are not stats on their site, 
even for famous players
  [Ons Jabeur ALETC page](https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/players/overview/wta316847/profile.html)
  [Novak Djokovic](https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/players/overview/atpd643.html)
  [Carlos Alcaraz](https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/players/overview/atpa0e2.html)
Profile does hold some information:
  Age, US$ won, best result at that tournament etc
