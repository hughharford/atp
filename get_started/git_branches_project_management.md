# AIM: to explain how git branches are used in the project to project manage

### Each branch represents an approach, or line of thinking
Objectives:
- Each git branch is targeted, clear and undertaken reasonably quickly
- Branches are named clearly so that visitors and contributors easily understand
- Branches work in different .ipynb notebooks to avoid conflicts
- Once merged, branches are kept, not deleted, to provide a record/notebook
- Branch understanding or success is brought across to master
- Git branch 'master' still reads as the best, and most current view
